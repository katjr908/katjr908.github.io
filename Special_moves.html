                Chess contains multiple special moves. They are all important to know just to be aware of during your game.

            <h3>En Passant</h3>
            <p>
                En passant is by far the least common move made. En passant is only possible when your pawn is on your 5th rank (your bottom row then go up 4 rows) and an adjacent enemy pawn moves TWO squares up, so that it is right next to your pawn. You have the option of capturing the pawn, as if it moved one square. Below is an example.

            <h3>Castling Kingside</h3>
            <p>
                Castling Kingside is considered one of the safest ways to protect your king. It is the most common form of castling, and activates your kingside rook. You cannot castle kingside if you have already moved your king or rook, if your king passes through check or if your king lands in check, and you can't castle out of check. When you castle kingside you move your king right two squares and move your rook to the other side of the king. Below shows an example of castling kingside.

            <h3>Castling Queenside</h3>
            <p>
                Castling Queenside is the alternative to castling kingside. You move your king to the right two squares and move the rook overr to the other side of the king. The same rules apply to castling queenside as do to castling kingside. You can't pass through check, you can't land in check, you can't castle if either your king or rook have moved, and you can't castle out of check. Below is a representation of castling queenside

            <h3>Promotion</h3>
            <p>
                Promotion occurs when a pawn reaches the end of the board. Because pawns can't move backwards, people made a rule called 'Promotion'. When a pawn promotes, it can turn into any piece except a pawn and a king. It can promote into a queen, knight, bishop, or rook. Even though the queen is the most popular choice, it is not always the best one. Your promotion choice is NOT limited to the pieces you have already lost.
