                    The pawn is considered by some to be the most useless piece on the board, but in fact they are very important. Each side starts with eight pawns each. Though they are weak, there are many reasons to appreciate the pawn.

                        <li>Pawns have the least value, therefor they make excellent defenders.</li>
                        <li>They help support pieces</li>
                        <li>They can promote (see special moves)</li>

                The pawn, on its first move and first move only, it has an option of moving two squares. If it chooses not to, it may not move two squares for the rest of the game. Pawns move one square forward, but capture one square diagonally.
